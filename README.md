# DH110_Assign5


<h2> Introduction </h2>

**Purpose:** the purpose of this assignment, creation and testing of the low fidelity prototype, is to verify if I am on the right direction concerning the layout of my app. And I want to see if the features I hope to enact will be easy to do for my target users.

**User Personas + Tasks:** My two user personas were mainly focused on being able to communicate with others and their desire to escape from the “now” by either going into fictitious worlds or learning about new things. So since they shared this in common my one of the tasks I decided for this assignment is to look for a book club and join it (an idea missing from my original persona assignment brought up by Professor Sookie). Besides this shared goal, one of my users experienced their fear of technology due to it not being accessible to her (i.e. her dominant language is not English). While the other user I wrote about experienced difficulty in remembering items. So for my last task I decided to ask the user to search for a book and favorite it as well as change the app’s language preference. For these two tasks, the user will be doing them both back to back because I want the ability to change the app’s language to be as easy/simple as possible. Simply put these two tasks should be easy to do because the difficulties they can create for an user will dismay them from using the app again.


Since the app is both a social and an archive app, users won’t simply do one task then end their session; their tasks/activities will build off from one after the other so I wanted this prototype to capture that. 


<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> I will be going point by point to talk about the steps the user took and the interesting results that came from them </p>

<h2>Wireframes </h2>
<p> some changes were made after this photo was taken so the additon of colored lines and the labeling of circles on the first photo/page of wireframes. </p>

**Task One: search for a book group**
<ol>
  <li>User searched for a book group by searching by genre instead of group --> Already surprised at the first step they took. </li>
  <li>user wrote down their own options in screen 3 of the search on the first row. This is indictive of an error on my end. I should I have put "options" or something in the blank spaces to show that by simply clicking on the search sign gives you options already. </li>
  <li>after screen 3, the steps were easy enough where they did the steps I hoped they world: i.e. clicking a group, then going to the next page and quickly clicking the "Join Button"</li>
</ol>

**Task Two: favorite a book**
<ol>
  <li>They had to think a bit on how to reach the page to favorite a book. they have been good about following the arrows but when they saw the page with the favorite "star" option, they worked backgrounds from that page instead of going forward/follwoing the arrows from the "join the book group" page.</li>
  <li>they have to utlize the search function again so instead of simply searching by title, they searched by genre again. Good to know that this feature might be popular/neccessary to have. I just have to think about how notify the users that they can simply use the search bar without and with any speciifcations. </li>
</ol>
