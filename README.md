# DH110_Assign5


<h2> Introduction </h2>

**Purpose:** the purpose of this assignment, creation and testing of the low fidelity prototype, is to verify if I am on the right direction concerning the layout of my app. And I want to see if the features I hope to enact will be easy to do for my target users.

**User Personas + Tasks:** My two user personas were mainly focused on being able to communicate with others and their desire to escape from the “now” by either going into fictitious worlds or learning about new things. The features that stemmed from these personas were: to create a book list, **to be able to favorite books (an app feature meant to be quick and easy to allow users to save books since titles can easily be forgotten** **to change the app’s language** (I noticed this is often an overlooked feature for websites outside of the big social media apps and the big social media apps; also, like music, readers read books from all around the world i.e. my favorite story is a korean webtoon called 치즈인더트랩) and to write reviews. For this assignment, I will revisit two of the features (the bolded ones above) here. I also added a new feature idea after I read the comments for this project.


So since they have the need of “communicating with others” in common,  one of the tasks I decided for this assignment is to look for a book club and join it (an idea missing from my original persona assignment brought up by Professor Sookie) Besides this shared goal, one of my users experienced their fear of technology due to it not being accessible to her (i.e. her dominant language is not English). While the other user I wrote about experienced difficulty in remembering items. So for my last task I decided to ask the user to search for a book and favorite it as well as change the app’s language preference. For these two tasks, the user will be doing them both back to back because I want the ability to change the app’s language to be as easy/simple as possible. Simply put these two tasks should be easy to do because the difficulties they can create for an user will dismay them from using the app again.

Since the app is both a social and an archive app, users won’t simply do one task then end their session; their tasks/activities will build off from one after the other so I wanted this prototype to capture that.

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> I will be going point by point to talk about the steps the user took and the interesting results that came from them </p>

<h2>Wireframes </h2>
<p> some changes were made after this photo was taken so the additon of colored lines and the labeling of circles on the first photo/page of wireframes. I also created the "JOIN" typo. </p>

**FIRST PAGE: wireframes are labelled as 1-3 left to right for the first row and second row is labelled 4-6, left to right as well.** specifiction made, since I may refer to the individual screens in my reflection.

<h2> Results: Images and WriteUp</h2>




**Task One: search for a book group**
<ol>
  <li>User searched for a book group by searching by genre instead of group --> Already surprised at the first step they took. if this was an actual app prototype they would not have beento do this and it wouldn't be an error on their part but mine since I 100% understand why they think groups can be searched by genre as well. </li>
  <li>user wrote down their own genre options in screen 3 of the first page. This is indictive of an error on my end. I should I have put "options" or something in the blank spaces to show that they exist to show that by simply clicking on the search sign, it gives you options to help with your search. </li>
  <li>after screen 3 on the first page, the steps were easy enough where they did the steps I hoped they world: i.e. clicking a group, then going to the next page and quickly clicking the "Join Button"</li>
</ol>

**Task Two: favorite a book**
<ol>
  <li>They had to think a bit on how to reach the page to favorite a book. they have been good about following the arrows but when they saw the page with the favorite "star" option, they worked backgrounds from that page instead of going forward/follwoing the arrows from the "join the book group" page.</li>
  <li>they have to utlize the search function again so instead of simply searching by title, they searched by genre again. Good to know that this feature might be popular/neccessary to have. I just have to think about how notify the users that they can simply use the search bar without and with any speciifcations. </li>

    <figcaption>user has now started the second task. they used another highlighter to indicate that that they chose the "search by genre" search option again. they also highlighted the star to indicate that they "saved/favorited" a book"</figcaption>

**Task Three: change the language of the app**
<ol>
  <li>this task was quite easy for them. THey did not face any notable difficulties. </li>
  <li>they made one error: instead of clicking the gear option to go to the setting pages, they clicked the "Edit profile" first. I do not think this is indicitive of anything significant about the prototype. </li>

<h2> Reflections </h2>
The biggest distraction for this protoype was my drawings. They were uneven and messy at times so the user took note of those characteristics. If I could do this project again, I would still do the wireframes by hand since it is good practice of protoyping sinced it is "easy" to be organizeded digitially. If I did this on my iPad, I could use alot of tools to make it neater but I think handwriting is more benaficial. The user was comfortable giving me feedback and I think the paper format contributed to that feeling of ease because they see it as a "not=so-serious" task. Interestingly enough, the user told me she thought the overall project was really easy. She jsut said that the paper format made it hard since she had to imagine it digitally. Not sure if I should see this as a postive or negative- I feel like it could be both. Positive because they were able to imagine my prototype as digital. Negative becuase it made me wonder if was it to messy/difficult to understand as it is. To add some errors, I made was forgetting to draw arrows for some of the back functions. While the tasks I had did not use them very much (nor did it "need" the arrows I forgot to draw) it is still important to note about thsi error so that I can reflect and be more aware for next time. Also, next time, I woudl emphasize more that the user can draw, write, highlight as they please --> the user didn't highlight any of the arrows trails they used so if this was a bigger group study and if none of the users highlighted the arrows they used, it would be difficult to know what pages were  possible page+tasksequences/buttons/ were more common and/or unused.


*note: I had to write "line skip" for some sections because no matter what I did, the lines would not skip.
